                        for success. But what constitutes good marketing is constantly evolving and

                    <p><span class="emphasis">The &#8220;Obama for America&#8221; presidential campaign
                            combined a charismatic politician, a powerful message of hope, and a
                            thoroughly integrated modern marketing program. The marketing plan needed to
                            accomplish two very different goals: expand the electorate via broader
                            messages while targeting very specific audiences. Multimedia tactics
                            combined offline and online media, as well as free and paid media. When
                            research showed that the more voters learned about Obama, the more they
                            identified with him, the campaign added long-form videos to traditional
                            print, broadcast, and outdoor ads. The Obama team&#8212;aided by its agency
                            GMMB&#8212;also put the Internet at the heart of the campaign, letting it
                            serve as the &#8220;central nervous system&#8221; for PR, advertising,
                            advance work, fund-raising, and organizing in all 50 states. Their guiding
                            philosophy was to &#8220;build online tools to help people self-organize and
                            then get out of their way.&#8221; Technology was a means to &#8220;empower
                            people to do what they were interested in doing in the first place.&#8221;
                            Although social media like Facebook, Meetup, YouTube, and Twitter were
                            crucial, perhaps Obama&#8217;s most powerful digital tool was a massive 13.5
                            million&#8211;name e-mail list. What were the results of these online
                            efforts? About $500 million (most in sums of less than $100) was raised
                            online from 3 million donors; 35,000 groups organized through the Web site,
                            My.BarackObama.com; 1,800 videos posted to YouTube; the creation of
                            Facebook&#8217;s most popular page; and, of course, the election of the next
                            President of the United States.</span><sup><a

                    </header>
                    <p>The first decade of the 21st century challenged firms to prosper financially and
                        even survive in the face of an unforgiving economic environment. Marketing is
                        playing a key role in addressing those challenges. Finance, operations,
                        accounting, and other business functions won&#8217;t really matter without
                        sufficient demand for products and services so the firm can make a profit. In
                        other words, there must be a top line for there to be a bottom line. Thus
                        financial success often depends on marketing ability.</p>
                    <p><a id="page26" class="pagebreak" title="26"></a>Marketing&#8217;s broader
                        importance extends to society as a whole. Marketing has helped introduce and
                        gain acceptance of new products that have eased or enriched people&#8217;s
                        lives. It can inspire enhancements in existing products as marketers innovate to
                        improve their position in the marketplace. Successful marketing builds demand
                        for products and services, which, in turn, creates jobs. By contributing to the
                        bottom line, successful marketing also allows firms to more fully engage in
                        socially responsible activities.<sup><a class="noteref noteref_endnote"

                        Consumer goods makers, health care insurers, nonprofit organizations, and
                        industrial product manufacturers all trumpet their latest marketing
                        achievements. Many now have a chief marketing officer (CMO) to put marketing on
                        a more equal footing with other C-level executives such as the chief financial
                        officer (CFO) or chief information officer (CIO).<sup><a

                    <p>Making the right marketing decisions isn&#8217;t always easy. One survey of more
                        than a thousand senior marketing and sales executives revealed that although 83
                        percent felt that marketing and sales capabilities were a top priority for their
                        organization&#8217;s success, in rating their actual marketing effectiveness,
                        only 6 percent felt that they were doing an &#8220;extremely good&#8221;

                    <p>Marketers must decide what features to design into a new product or service, what

                        on advertising, sales, the Internet, or mobile marketing. They must make those
                        decisions in an Internet-fueled environment where consumers, competition,
                        technology, and economic forces change rapidly, and the consequences of the

                            North Carolina, posted a YouTube video showing themselves preparing
                            sandwiches while putting cheese up their noses and violating other
                            health-code standards, Domino&#8217;s learned an important lesson about PR
                            and brand communications in a modern era. Once it found the

                            never delivered&#8212;the company fired them. In just a few days, however,
                            there had been more than a million downloads of the video and a wave of
                            negative publicity. When research showed that perception of quality for the
                            brand had turned from positive to negative in that short time, the firm

                        swiftly and decisively. While marketers were coming to grips with this
                        increasingly wired world, the economic recession of 2008&#8211;2009 brought
                        budget cuts and intense pressure from senior management to make every marketing
                        dollar count. More than ever, marketers need to understand and adapt to the
                        latest marketplace developments. At greatest risk are firms that fail to
                        carefully monitor their customers and competitors, continuously improve their
                        value offerings and marketing strategies, or satisfy their employees,

                            human and social needs. One of the shortest good definitions of marketing is
                            &#8220;meeting needs profitably.&#8221; When eBay recognized that people
                            were unable to locate some of the items they desired most, it created an
                            online auction clearinghouse. When IKEA noticed that people wanted good
                            furnishings at substantially lower prices, it created knockdown furniture.
                            These two firms demonstrated marketing savvy and turned a private or social
                            need into a profitable business opportunity.</p>
                        <p>The American Marketing Association offers the following formal definition:
                                <span class="emphasis">Marketing is the activity, set of institutions,
                                and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging
                                offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society
                                at large.</span><sup><a class="noteref noteref_endnote"

                                    >7</a></sup> Coping with these exchange processes calls for a
                            considerable amount of work and skill. <span class="emphasis">Marketing
                                management</span> takes place when at least one party to a potential
                            exchange thinks about the means of achieving desired responses from other
                            parties. Thus we see <a href="Z03_KOTL3360_14_PIE_GLOS.xhtml#glo220"
                                class="keyterm"><span class="strong">marketing management</span></a>
                            <span class="emphasis">as the art and science of choosing target markets and
                                getting, keeping, and growing customers through creating, delivering,
                                and communicating superior customer value.</span></p>
                        <p>We can distinguish between a social and a managerial definition of marketing.
                            A social definition shows the role marketing plays in society; for example,
                            one marketer has said that marketing&#8217;s role is to &#8220;deliver a
                            higher standard of living.&#8221; Here is a social definition that serves
                            our purpose: <span class="emphasis">Marketing is a societal process by which
                                individuals and groups obtain what they need and want through creating,
                                offering, and freely exchanging products and services of value with
                                others.</span></p>
                        <p>Managers sometimes think of marketing as &#8220;the art of selling
                            products,&#8221; but many people are surprised when they hear that selling
                            is not the most important part of marketing! Selling is only the tip of the
                            marketing iceberg. Peter Drucker, a leading management theorist, puts it
                            this way:</p>
                        <div class="blockquotegroup">
                            <blockquote><p>There will always, one can assume, be need for some selling.
                                    But the aim of marketing is to make selling superfluous. The aim of
                                    marketing is to know and understand the customer so well that the
                                    product or service fits him and sells itself. Ideally, marketing
                                    should result in a customer who is ready to buy. All that should be
                                    needed then is to make the product or service available.<sup><a

                            experiences, persons, places, properties, organizations, information, and
                            ideas. Let&#8217;s take a quick look at these categories.</p>
                        <p><span class="strong">GOODS</span> Physical goods constitute the bulk of most
                            countries&#8217; production and marketing efforts. Each year, U.S. companies

                            proportion of their activities focuses on the production of ser vices. The
                            U.S. economy today produces a 70&#8211;30 ser vices-to-goods mix. Services
                            include the work of airlines, hotels, car rental firms, barbers and
                            beauticians, maintenance and repair people, and accountants, bankers,
                            lawyers, engineers, doctors, software programmers, and management
                            consultants. Many market offerings mix goods and services, such as a
                            fast-food meal.</p>
                        <p><span class="strong">EVENTS</span> Marketers promote time-based events, such
                            as major trade shows, artistic performances, and company anniversaries.
                            Global sporting events such as the Olympics and the World Cup are promoted
                            aggressively to both companies and fans.</p>

                            what they do. Just as production and logistics professionals are responsible
                            for supply management, marketers are responsible for demand management. They
                            seek to influence the level, timing, and composition of demand to meet the
                            organization&#8217;s objectives. Eight demand states are possible:</p>

                        <p>In each case, marketers must identify the underlying cause(s) of the demand

                        <p><span class="strong">MARKETS</span> Traditionally, a &#8220;market&#8221; was
                            a physical place where buyers and sellers gathered to buy and sell goods.
                            Economists describe a <span class="emphasis">market</span> as a collection
                            of buyers and sellers who transact over a particular product or product
                            class (such as the housing market or the grain market).</p>
                        <p>Five basic markets and their connecting flows are shown in <img

                                1.1.</a> Manufacturers go to resource markets (raw material markets,
                            labor markets, money markets), buy resources and turn them into goods and
                            services, and sell finished products to intermediaries, who sell them to
                            consumers. Consumers sell their labor and receive money with which they pay
                            for goods and services. The government collects tax revenues to buy goods
                            from resource, manufacturer, and intermediary markets and uses these goods
                            and services to provide public services. Each nation&#8217;s economy, and
                            the global economy, consists of interacting sets of markets linked through
                            exchange processes.</p>

                            groupings of customers. They view sellers as constituting the industry and
                            buyers as constituting the market. They talk about need markets (the
                            diet-seeking market), product markets (the shoe market), demographic markets
                            (the youth market), and geographic markets (the Chinese market); or they
                            extend the concept to cover voter markets, labor markets, and donor markets,
                            for instance.</p>

                            Sellers and buyers are connected by four flows. Sellers send goods and
                            services and communications such as ads and direct mail to the market; in
                            return they receive money and information such as customer attitudes and
                            sales data. The inner loop shows an exchange of money for goods and
                            services; the outer loop shows an exchange of information.</p>

                            Companies selling mass consumer goods and services such as juices,
                            cosmetics, athletic shoes, and air travel spend a great deal of time
                            establishing a strong brand image by developing a superior product and
                            packaging, ensuring its availability, and backing it with engaging
                            communications and reliable service.</p>
                        <p><span class="strong"><span class="emphasis">Business Markets</span></span>
                            Companies selling business goods and services often face well-informed
                            professional buyers skilled at evaluating competitive offerings. Business
                            buyers buy goods to make or resell a product to others at a profit. Business
                            marketers must demonstrate how their products will help achieve higher
                            revenue or lower costs. Advertising can play a role, but the sales force,
                            the price, and the company&#8217;s reputation may play a greater one.</p>

                            Companies in the global marketplace must decide which countries to enter;
                            how to enter each (as an exporter, licenser, joint venture partner, contract
                            manufacturer, or solo manufacturer); how to adapt product and service
                            features to each country; how to price products in different countries; and
                            how to design communications for different cultures. They face different
                            requirements for buying and disposing of property; cultural, language, legal
                            and political differences; and currency fluctuations. Yet, the payoff can be

                            on practical solutions and favor the lowest bid in the absence of

                            proposed the concept of a <span class="emphasis">metamarket</span> to
                            describe a cluster of complementary products and services closely related in
                            the minds of consumers, but spread across a diverse set of industries.</p>
                        <p>Metamarkets are the result of marketers packaging a system that simplifies
                            carrying out these related product/service activities. The automobile
                            metamarket consists of automobile manufacturers, new and used car dealers,
                            financing companies, insurance companies, mechanics, spare parts dealers,
                            service shops, auto magazines, classified auto ads in newspapers, and auto
                            sites on the Internet.</p>
                        <p>A car buyer will engage many parts of this metamarket, creating an

                        </header>
                        <p><span class="emphasis">Needs</span> are the basic human requirements such as
                            for air, food, water, clothing, and shelter. Humans also have strong needs
                            for recreation, education, and entertainment. These needs become <span
                                class="emphasis">wants</span>
                            <a id="page32" class="pagebreak" title="32"></a>when they are directed to
                            specific objects that might satisfy the need. A U.S. consumer needs food but
                            may want a Philly cheesesteak and an iced tea. A person in Afghanistan needs
                            food but may want rice, lamb, and carrots. Wants are shaped by our
                            society.</p>
                        <p><span class="emphasis">Demands</span> are wants for specific products backed
                            by an ability to pay. Many people want a Mercedes; only a few are able to
                            buy one. Companies must measure not only how many people want their product,
                            but also how many are willing and able to buy it.</p>
                        <p>These distinctions shed light on the frequent criticism that &#8220;marketers
                            create needs&#8221; or &#8220;marketers get people to buy things they
                            don&#8217;t want.&#8221; Marketers do not create needs: Needs preexist
                            marketers. Marketers, along with other societal factors, influence wants.
                            They might promote the idea that a Mercedes would satisfy a person&#8217;s
                            need for social status. They do not, however, create the need for social
                            status.</p>
                        <p>Some customers have needs of which they are not fully conscious or that they
                            cannot articulate. What does it mean when the customer asks for a
                            &#8220;powerful&#8221; lawn mower or a &#8220;peaceful&#8221; hotel? The
                            marketer must probe further. We can distinguish five types of needs:</p>
                        <ol class="numeric">
                            <li><p>Stated needs (The customer wants an inexpensive car.)</p></li>
                            <li><p>Real needs (The customer wants a car whose operating cost, not
                                    initial price, is low.)</p></li>
                            <li><p>Unstated needs (The customer expects good service from the
                                    dealer.)</p></li>
                            <li><p>Delight needs (The customer would like the dealer to include an
                                    onboard GPS navigation system.)</p></li>
                            <li><p>Secret needs (The customer wants friends to see him or her as a savvy
                                    consumer.)</p></li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Responding only to the stated need may shortchange the customer.<sup><a

                        <p>Not everyone likes the same cereal, restaurant, college, or movie. Therefore,
                            marketers start by dividing the market into segments. They identify and
                            profile distinct groups of buyers who might prefer or require varying
                            product and service mixes by examining demographic, psychographic, and
                            behavioral differences among buyers.</p>
                        <p>After identifying market segments, the marketer decides which present the
                            greatest opportunities&#8212; which are its target <span class="emphasis"
                                >markets</span>. For each, the firm develops a <span class="emphasis"
                                >market offering</span> that it <span class="emphasis">positions</span>
                            in the minds of the target buyers as delivering some central benefit(s).

                                    class="strong">value proposition</span></a>, a set of benefits that
                            satisfy those needs. The intangible value proposition is made physical by an
                                <span class="emphasis">Offering</span>, which can be a combination of
                            products, services, information, and experiences.</p>
                        <p>A <span class="emphasis">brand</span> is an offering from a known source. A
                            brand name such as McDonald&#8217;s carries many associations in
                            people&#8217;s minds that make up its image: hamburgers, cleanliness,
                            convenience, courteous service, and golden arches. All companies strive to
                            build a brand image with as many strong, favorable, and unique brand
                            associations as possible.</p>

                        </header>
                        <p>The buyer chooses the offerings he or she perceives to deliver the most <span
                                class="emphasis">value</span>, the sum of the tangible and intangible
                            benefits and costs to her. Value, a central marketing concept, is primarily
                            a combination of quality, service, and price (qsp), called the <span
                                class="emphasis">customer value triad</span>. Value perceptions increase
                            with quality and service but decrease with price.</p>
                        <p>We can think of marketing as the identification, creation, communication,
                            delivery, and monitoring of customer value. <span class="emphasis"
                                >Satisfaction</span> reflects a person&#8217;s judgment of a
                            product&#8217;s perceived performance in relationship to expectations. If
                            the performance falls short of expectations, the customer is disappointed.
                            If it matches expectations, the customer is satisfied. If it exceeds them,
                            the customer is delighted.</p>

                        </header>
                        <p>To reach a target market, the marketer uses three kinds of marketing
                            channels. <span class="emphasis">Communication channels</span> deliver and
                            receive messages from target buyers and include newspapers, magazines,
                            radio, television, mail, telephone, billboards, posters, fliers, CDs,
                            audiotapes, and the Internet. Beyond these, firms communicate through the
                            look of their retail stores and Web sites and other media. Marketers are
                            increasingly adding dialogue channels such as e-mail, blogs, and toll-free
                            numbers to familiar monologue channels such as ads.</p>
                        <p>The marketer uses <span class="emphasis">distribution channels</span> to
                            display, sell, or deliver the physical product or service(s) to the buyer or
                            user. These channels may be direct via the Internet, mail, or mobile phone
                            or telephone, or indirect with distributors, wholesalers, retailers, and
                            agents as intermediaries.</p>
                        <p>To carry out transactions with potential buyers, the marketer also uses <span
                                class="emphasis">service channels</span> that include warehouses,
                            transportation companies, banks, and insurance companies. Marketers clearly
                            face a design challenge in choosing the best mix of communication,
                            distribution, and service channels for their offerings.</p>

                        </header>
                        <p>The supply chain is a longer channel stretching from raw materials to
                            components to finished products carried to final buyers. The supply chain
                            for coffee may start with Ethiopian farmers who plant, tend, and pick the
                            coffee beans, selling their harvest to wholesalers or perhaps a Fair Trade
                            cooperative. If sold through the cooperative, the coffee is washed, dried,
                            and packaged for shipment by an Alternative Trading Organization (ATO) that
                            pays a minimum of $1.26 a pound. The ATO transports the coffee to the
                            developing world where it can sell it directly or via retail channels. Each
                            company captures only a certain percentage of the total value generated by
                            the supply chain&#8217;s value delivery system. When a company acquires
                            competitors or expands upstream or downstream, its aim is to capture a
                            higher percentage of supply chain value.</p>

                        </header>
                        <p>Competition includes all the actual and potential rival offerings and
                            substitutes a buyer might consider. An automobile manufacturer can buy steel
                            from U.S. Steel in the United States, from a foreign firm in Japan or Korea,
                            or from a minimill such as Nucor at a cost savings, or it can buy aluminum
                            for certain parts from Alcoa to reduce the car&#8217;s weight, or engineered
                            plastics from Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC) instead of steel.
                            Clearly, U.S. Steel would be thinking too narrowly about its competition if
                            it thought only of other integrated steel companies. In the long run, U.S.
                            Steel is more likely to be hurt by substitute products than by other steel
                            companies.</p>

                        <p>The marketing environment consists of the task environment and the broad
                            environment. The <span class="emphasis">task environment</span> includes the
                            actors engaged in producing, distributing, and promoting the offering. These
                            are the company, suppliers, distributors, dealers, and target customers. In
                            the supplier group are material suppliers and service suppliers, such as
                            marketing research agencies, advertising agencies, banking and insurance
                            companies, transportation companies, and telecommunications companies.
                            Distributors and dealers include agents, brokers, manufacturer
                            representatives, and others who facilitate finding and selling to
                            customers.</p>
                        <p>The <span class="emphasis">broad environment</span> consists of six
                            components: demographic environment, economic environment, social-cultural
                            environment, natural environment, technological environment, and
                            political-legal environment. Marketers must pay close attention to the
                            trends and developments in these and adjust their marketing strategies as
                            needed. New opportunities are constantly emerging that await the right

                            <p>Allrecipes.com has cooked up a winning online formula by blending recipes
                                posted by individuals with those provided by corporations promoting
                                their own products like Kraft cheese or Campbell&#8217;s Soup. After

                        <p>Not surprisingly, these new marketing forces and capabilities have profoundly
                            changed marketing management. In theory, the marketing <span
                                class="emphasis">planning</span> process consists of analyzing marketing
                            opportunities, selecting target markets, designing marketing strategies,
                            developing marketing programs, and managing the marketing effort. <a

                            the highly competitive marketplaces that are more often the norm, marketing
                            planning is more fluid and is continually refreshed.</p>
                        <p>Companies must always be moving forward with marketing programs, innovating
                            products and services, staying in touch with customer needs, and seeking new
                            advantages rather than relying on past strengths. This is especially true of
                            incorporating the Internet into marketing plans. Marketers must try to
                            balance increased spending on search advertising, social media, direct
                            e-mail, and text/SMS marketing efforts with appropriate spending on
                            traditional marketing communications. But they must do so in tough economic
                            times, when accountability has become a top priority and returns on
                            investment are expected from every marketing activity. &#8220;Marketing
                            Insight: Marketing in an Age of Turbulence&#8221; offers some
                            recommendations for adjusting to new marketing realities.</p>

                                CMO</span> The rapidly changing marketing environment is putting even
                            greater demands on marketing executives. A well-publicized survey revealed
                            that the average CMO tenure at U.S. companies is about 28 months, well below
                            the average tenure of CEOs (54 months) or other C-level positions. One
                            explanation is that the role of marketing&#8212;and thus management
                            expectations&#8212;varies widely among firms. Harvard&#8217;s Gail McGovern
                            and John Quelch find tremendous variability in CMO responsibilities and job

                        <p>Another challenge CMOs face is that the success factors for top marketers are
                            many and varied. CMOs must have strong quantitative skills but also
                            well-honed qualitative skills; they must have an independent,
                            entrepreneurial attitude but also work in close harmony with other
                            departments such as sales; and they must capture the &#8220;voice&#8221; and

                    </header>
                    <p>The severe economic recession of 2008&#8211;2009 caused marketers to rethink best
                        practices of management. Philip Kotler and John Caslione see management entering
                        a new Age of Turbulence in which chaos, risk, and uncertainty characterize many
                        industries, markets, and companies. According to them, turbulence is the new
                        normal, punctuated by periodic and intermittent spurts of prosperity and
                        downturn&#8212;including extended downturns amounting to recession, or even
                        depression. They see many new challenges in the foreseeable future, and unlike
                        past recessions, there may be no assurance that a return to past management
                        practices would ever be successful again.</p>
                    <p>According to Kotler and Caslione, marketers should always be ready to activate
                        automatic responses when turbulence whips up and chaos reigns in. They recommend

                        company&#8217;s marketing efforts? Increasingly, marketers operate consistent
                        with the holistic marketing concept. Let&#8217;s first review the evolution of
                        earlier marketing ideas.</p>

                            concepts in business. It holds that consumers prefer products that are
                            widely available and inexpensive. Managers of production-oriented businesses
                            concentrate on achieving high production efficiency, low costs, and mass
                            distribution. This orientation makes sense in developing countries such as
                            China, where the largest PC manufacturer, Legend (principal owner of Lenovo
                            Group), and domestic appliances giant Haier take advantage of the
                            country&#8217;s huge and inexpensive labor pool to dominate the market.
                            Marketers also use the production concept when they want to expand the
                                    market.<sup><a class="noteref noteref_endnote"

                        <p>The <span class="strong">holistic marketing</span> concept is based on the

                    <p>Increasingly, a key goal of marketing is to develop deep, enduring relationships
                        with people and organizations that directly or indirectly affect the success of
                        the firm&#8217;s marketing activities. Relationship marketing aims to build
                        mutually satisfying long-term relationships with key constituents in order to
                        earn and retain their business.<sup><a class="noteref noteref_endnote"
                                href="Z02_KOTL3360_14_PIE_NOTE.xhtml#NOTE_sec_02_para_044_3360"

                    <p>Four key constituents for relationship marketing are customers, employees,
                        marketing partners (channels, suppliers, distributors, dealers, agencies), and
                        members of the financial community (shareholders, investors, analysts).
                        Marketers must create prosperity among all these constituents and balance the
                        returns to all key stakeholders. To develop strong relationships with them
                        requires understanding their capabilities and resources, needs, goals, and
                        desires.</p>
                    <p>The ultimate outcome of relationship marketing is a unique company asset called a
                            <a href="Z03_KOTL3360_14_PIE_GLOS.xhtml#glo222" class="keyterm"><span
                                class="strong">marketing network</span></a>, consisting of the company
                        and its supporting stakeholders&#8212;customers, employees, suppliers,
                        distributors, retailers, and others&#8212;with whom it has built mutually
                        profitable business relationships. The operating principle is simple: build an
                        effective network of relationships with key stakeholders, and profits will
                                follow.<sup><a class="noteref noteref_endnote"

                            >45</a></sup> Thus more companies are choosing to own brands rather than
                        physical assets and are subcontracting activities to firms that can do them
                        better and more cheaply, while retaining core activities at home.</p>
                    <p>Companies are also shaping separate offers, services, and messages to <span
                            class="emphasis">individual customers</span>, based on information about
                        past transactions, demographics, psychographics, and media and distribution
                        preferences. By focusing on their most profitable customers, products, and
                        channels, these firms hope to achieve profitable growth, capturing a larger
                        share of each customer&#8217;s expenditures by building high customer loyalty.
                        They estimate individual customer lifetime value and design their market
                        offerings and prices to make a profit over the customer&#8217;s lifetime.</p>
                    <p>These activities fall under what Columbia Business School professor Larry Selden
                        and his wife and business consulting partner, Yoko Sugiura Selden, call

                            terms of customer segments rather than product segments, Royal Bank of
                            Canada (RBC) has put each of its roughly 11 million clients into meaningful
                            segments whose profitability it can measure. In the process, it discovered a
                            sizable subsegment of customers hidden within its broader categories of
                            &#8220;wealth preservers&#8221; and &#8220;wealth accumulators.&#8221;
                            Dubbed &#8220;snowbirds,&#8221; these individuals spent a number of months
                            each winter in Florida, where they were experiencing difficulties
                            establishing credit as well as missing their Canadian communities,
                            particularly the familiarity of the French-Canadian accent and fluency in
                            French. To meet their unique needs, RBC created a Canadian banking

                    <p>Because attracting a new customer may cost five times as much as retaining an
                        existing one, relationship marketing also emphasizes customer retention.
                        Companies build customer share by offering a larger variety of goods to existing
                        customers, training employees in cross-selling and upselling. Marketing must
                        skillfully conduct not only customer relationship management (CRM), but partner
                        relationship management (PRM) as well. Companies are deepening their partnering
                        arrangements with key suppliers and distributors, seeing them as partners in
                        delivering value to final customers so everybody benefits.</p>

                    </header>
                    <p>Integrated marketing occurs when the marketer devises marketing activities and
                        assembles marketing programs to create, communicate, and deliver value for
                        consumers such that &#8220;the whole is greater than the sum of its
                        parts.&#8221; Two key themes are that (1) many different marketing activities
                        can create, communicate, and deliver value and (2) marketers should design and
                        implement any one marketing activity with all other activities in mind. When a
                        hospital buys an MRI from General Electric&#8217;s Medical Systems division, for
                        instance, it expects good installation, maintenance, and training services to go
                        with the purchase.</p>
                    <p><a id="page43" class="pagebreak" title="43"></a>All company communications also
                        must be integrated. Using an integrated communication strategy means choosing
                        communication options that reinforce and complement each other. A marketer might
                        selectively employ television, radio, and print advertising, public relations
                        and events, and PR and Web site communications so each contributes on its own as
                        well as improving the effectiveness of the others. Each must also deliver a
                        consistent brand message at every contact.</p>
                    <p>When BMW launched the modernized MINI Cooper in 2002, it employed an integrated
                        marketing strategy in the United States that included a broad mix of media:
                        billboards, posters, Internet, print, PR, product placement, and grassroots
                        campaigns. Many were linked to a cleverly designed Web site with product and

                        Marketers must weigh the trade-off between having too many channels (leading to
                        conflict among channel members and/or a lack of support) and too few (resulting

                    <p>As goods become more commoditized, and consumers grow more socially conscious,
                        some companies&#8212;including The Body Shop, Timberland, and
                        Patagonia&#8212;incorporate social responsibility as a way to differentiate
                        themselves from competitors, build consumer preference, and achieve notable
                        sales and profit gains. When they founded Ben &#38; Jerry&#8217;s, Ben Cohen and
                        Jerry Greenfield embraced the performance marketing concept by dividing the
                        traditional financial bottom line into a &#8220;double bottom line&#8221; that
                        also measured the environmental impact of their products and processes. That
                        later expanded into a &#8220;triple bottom line,&#8221; to represent the social
                        impacts, negative and positive, of the firm&#8217;s entire range of business

                        <p><span class="strong">Stonyfield Farm</span> Social responsibility has been at
                            the core of Stonyfield Farm&#8212;makers of all-natural organic
                            yogurts&#8212;from the start. Stonyfield&#8217;s suppliers eschew the
                            productivity practices of agribusiness, including the use of antibiotics,
                            growth hormones, pesticides, and fertilizers. After calculating the amount
                            of energy used to run its plant, Stonyfield decided to make an equivalent
                            investment in environmental projects such as reforestation and wind farms.
                            The company dropped plastic lids on its yogurt, saving about a million
                            pounds of plastic a year, and added on-package messages about global
                            warming, the perils of hormones, and genetically modified foods. It makes
                            low-fat versions of its products, and adds cultures or dietary supplements
                            to help the immune system fight off illness. The attitudes and beliefs
                            Stonyfield adopted have not hurt its financial performance as it has become
                            the number-three yogurt brand in the United States.<sup><a

                        exemplified by holistic marketing&#8212;clearly these four Ps are not the whole
                        story anymore. If we update them to reflect the holistic marketing concept, we
                        arrive at a more representative set that encompasses modern marketing realities:
                        people, processes, programs, and performance, as in <img src="images/Icon_2.jpg"

                        be as good as the people inside the organization. It also reflects the fact that
                        marketers must view consumers as people to understand their lives more broadly,
                        and not just as they shop for and consume products and services.</p>

                        and concepts play an appropriate role in all they do. Only by instituting the
                        right set of processes to guide activities and programs can a firm engage in
                        mutually beneficial long-term relationships. Another important set of processes
                        guides the firm in imaginatively generating insights and breakthrough products,

                        greater than the sum of their parts and they accomplish multiple objectives for
                        the firm.</p>

                        Marketers&#8217; Frequently Asked Questions&#8221; is a good checklist for the

                                Corporate management is considering what to do with its Atlas camera
                                division, which produces a range of 35mm and digital cameras. Although
                                Zeus has a sizable share and is producing revenue, the 35mm market is
                                rapidly declining. In the much faster-growing digital camera segment,
                                Zeus faces strong competition and has been slow to gain sales.
                                Zeus&#8217;s corporate management wants Atlas&#8217;s marketing group to

                            can design its cameras with better features. It can make a line of video

                            binoculars and telescopes. Whichever direction it chooses, it must develop

                            with excellent service and strong advertising? Should it build a simple,

                    <ol class="numeric">
                        <li><p>Marketing is an organizational function and a set of processes for
                                creating, communicating, and delivering value to customers and for
                                managing customer relationships in ways that benefit the organization
                                and its stakeholders. Marketing management is the art and science of
                                choosing target markets and getting, keeping, and growing customers
                                through creating, delivering, and communicating superior customer
                                value.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Marketers are skilled at managing demand: they seek to influence its
                                level, timing, and composition for goods, services, events, experiences,
                                persons, places, properties, organizations, information, and ideas. They
                                also operate in four different marketplaces: consumer, business, global,
                                and nonprofit.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Marketing is not done only by the marketing department. It needs to
                                affect every aspect of the customer experience. To create a strong
                                marketing organization, marketers must think like executives in other
                                departments, and executives in other departments must think more like
                                marketers.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Today&#8217;s marketplace is fundamentally different as a result of major
                                societal forces that have resulted in many new consumer and company
                                capabilities. These forces have created new opportunities and challenges
                                and changed marketing management significantly as companies seek new
                                ways to achieve marketing excellence.</p></li>
                        <li><p>There are five competing concepts under which organizations can choose to
                                conduct their business: the production concept, the product concept, the
                                selling concept, the marketing concept, and the holistic marketing
                                concept. The first three are of limited use today.</p></li>
                        <li><p>The holistic marketing concept is based on the development, design, and
                                implementation of marketing programs, processes, and activities that
                                recognize their breadth and interdependencies. Holistic marketing
                                recognizes that everything matters in marketing and that a broad,
                                integrated perspective is often necessary. Four components of holistic
                                marketing are relationship marketing, integrated marketing, internal
                                marketing, and socially responsible marketing.</p></li>
                        <li><p>The set of tasks necessary for successful marketing management includes
                                developing marketing strategies and plans, capturing marketing insights,
                                connecting with customers, building strong brands, shaping the market
                                offerings, delivering and communicating value, and creating long-term

                            athletes helped it build a cult following among U.S. consumers.</p>
                        <p>Nike believed in a &#8220;pyramid of influence&#8221; in which the
                            preferences of a small percentage of top athletes influenced the product and
                            brand choices of others. From the start its marketing campaigns featured
                            accomplished athletes. Runner Steve Prefontaine, the first spokesperson, had
                            an irreverent attitude that matched the company&#8217;s spirit.</p>
                        <p>In 1985, Nike signed up then-rookie guard Michael Jordan as a spokesperson.
                            Jordan was still an up-andcomer, but he personified superior performance.
                            Nike&#8217;s bet paid off&#8212;the Air Jordan line of basketball shoes flew
                            off the shelves and revenues hit over $100 million in the first year alone.
                            As one reporter stated, &#8220;Few marketers have so reliably been able to
                            identify and sign athletes who transcend their sports to such great
                            effect.&#8221;</p>
                        <p>In 1988, Nike aired the first ads in its $20 million &#8220;Just Do It&#8221;
                            ad campaign. The campaign, which ultimately featured 12 TV spots in all,
                            subtly challenged a generation of athletic enthusiasts to chase their goals.
                            It was a natural manifestation of Nike&#8217;s attitude of self-empowerment
                            through sports.</p>
                        <p>As Nike began expanding overseas to Europe, it found that its U.S.-style ads
                            were seen as too aggressive. Nike realized it had to
                            &#8220;authenticate&#8221; its brand in Europe, so it focused on soccer
                            (known as football outside the United States) and became active as a sponsor
                            of youth leagues, local clubs, and national teams. However, for Nike to
                            build authenticity among the soccer audience, consumers had to see
                            professional athletes using its product, especially athletes who won.
                            Nike&#8217;s big break came in 1994 when the Brazilian team (the only
                            national team for which Nike had any real sponsorship) won the World Cup.
                            That victory transformed Nike&#8217;s image in Europe from a sneaker company
                            into a brand that represented emotion, allegiance, and identification. It
                            also helped launch Nike into other international markets over the next
                            decade, and by 2003, overseas revenues surpassed U.S. revenues for the first
                            time.</p>
                        <p>In 2007, Nike acquired Umbro, a British maker of soccer-related footwear,
                            apparel, and equipment. The acquisition helped boost Nike&#8217;s presence
                            in soccer as the company became the sole supplier of uniforms to over 100
                            professional soccer teams around the world.</p>
                        <p>Nike focused its efforts on international markets, especially China, during
                            the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Although Nike&#8217;s rival, Adidas,
                            was the official sponsor of the Olympic Games, Nike received special
                            permission from the International Olympic Committee to run Nike ads
                            featuring Olympic athletes during the games. In addition, Nike sponsored
                            several teams and athletes, including most of the Chinese teams and 11 of
                            the 12 high-profile members on the United States men&#8217;s basketball
                            teams. That year, sales in the Asian region grew 15 percent to $3.3 billion
                            and Nike&#8217;s international divisions grew to 53 percent of the
                            company&#8217;s revenue. Some believed Nike&#8217;s marketing strategy
                            during the Olympics was more effective than Adidas&#8217;s Olympic
                            sponsorship.</p>
                        <p>In addition to expanding the brand overseas, Nike successfully entered new
                            athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment product categories by using
                            endorsements from high-profile athletes and consumer outreach programs. The
                            Nike Golf brand, endorsed by Tiger Woods, has changed the way professional
                            golfers dress. Tiger&#8217;s powerful influence on the game and his Nike
                            emblazoned style have turned the greens at the majors into
                            &#8220;golf&#8217;s fashion runway.&#8221; In addition, Nike has used the
                            superstar to help build its relationship with consumers. In 2009, it
                            launched a Tiger Web Talkback session at nikegolf.com, where fans could ask
                            questions and hear Tiger talk about golf. The session was part of a
                            nationwide Nike Golf consumer experience day, which included equipment
                            demos, long-drive contests, and in-store specials.</p>
                        <p>In tennis, Nike has aligned with Maria Sharapova, Roger Federer, and Rafael
                            Nadal to push its line of tennis clothing and gear. Some called the famous
                            2008 Wimbledon match between Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal&#8212;both
                            dressed in swooshes from head to toe&#8212;a five-hour Nike commercial
                            valued at $10.6 million.</p>
                        <p>Nike teamed up with seven-time Tour de France champion Lance Armstrong not
                            only to sell Nike products but also to help Armstrong&#8217;s LIVESTRONG
                            campaign. Nike designed, manufactured, and sold over 70 million yellow
                            LIVESTRONG bracelets, netting $80 million for the Lance Armstrong
                            Foundation. It also featured Armstrong&#8217;s message of survival,
                            willpower, and giving in a series of Nike commercials.</p>
                        <p>To promote its line of basketball shoes and apparel, Nike continues to
                            feature basketball superstars such as Kobe Bryant and LeBron James. In
                            addition, it formed a partnership with Foot Locker to create a new chain of
                            stores, House <a id="page52" class="pagebreak" title="52"></a>of Hoops by
                            Foot Locker, which offers only basketball products by Nike brands such as
                            Converse and Jordan.</p>
                        <p>Recently, Nike&#8217;s lead in the running category has grown to 60 percent
                            market share thanks to its exclusive partnership with Apple. Nike+ (Plus)
                            technology includes a sensor that runners put into their running shoes and a
                            receiver, which fits into an iPod, iTouch, or iPhone. When the athlete goes
                            for a run or hits the gym, the receiver captures his or her mileage,
                            calories burned, and pace and stores it until the information is downloaded.
                            Nike+ is now considered the world&#8217;s largest running club.</p>
                        <p>In 2008 and 2009, Nike+ hosted the Human Race 10K, the largest and only
                            global virtual race in the world. The event, designed to celebrate running,
                            drew 780,000 participants in 2008 and surpassed that number in 2009. To
                            participate, runners register online, gear up with Nike+ technology, and hit
                            the road on race day, running any 10K route they choose at any time during
                            the day. Once the data is downloaded from the Nike+ receiver, each
                            runner&#8217;s official time is posted and can be compared to the times of
                            runners from around the world.</p>
                        <p>Like many companies, Nike is trying to make its company and products more
                            eco-friendly. However, unlike many companies, Nike does not promote its
                            efforts. One brand consultant explained, &#8220;Nike has always been about
                            winning. How is sustainability relevant to its brand?&#8221; Nike executives
                            agree that promoting an eco-friendly message would distract from its slick
                            high-tech image, so efforts like recycling old shoes into new shoes are kept
                            quiet.</p>
                        <p>Today, Nike dominates the athletic footwear market with a 31 percent market
                            share globally and a 50 percent market share in the United States. Swooshes
                            abound on everything from wristwatches to skateboards to swimming caps. The
                            firm&#8217;s long-term strategy focuses on basketball, running, football,
                            women&#8217;s fitness, men&#8217;s training, and sports culture. As a result
                            of its successful expansion across geographic markets and product
                            categories, Nike is the top athletic apparel and footwear manufacturer in
                            the world, with corporate fiscal 2009 revenues exceeding $19 billion.</p>

                        <p>In 1998, two Stanford University PhD students, Larry Page and Sergey Brin,
                            founded a search engine company and named it Google. The name plays on the
                            number googol&#8212;1 followed by 100 zeroes&#8212;and refers to the massive
                            quantity of data available online that the company helps users find.
                            Google&#8217;s corporate mission is &#8220;To organize the world&#8217;s
                            information and make it universally accessible and useful.&#8221; From the
                            beginning, Google has strived to be one of the &#8220;good guys&#8221; in
                            the corporate world, supporting a touchy-feely work environment, strong
                            ethics, and a famous founding credo: &#8220;Don&#8217;t be evil.&#8221;</p>
                        <p>The company has become the market leader for search engines through its
                            business focus and constant innovation. As Google grew into a primary
                            destination for Web users searching for information online, it attracted a
                            host of online advertisers. These advertisers drove Google&#8217;s revenue
                            by buying &#8220;search ads,&#8221; little text-based boxes shown alongside
                            search results that advertisers pay for only when users click on them.
                            Google&#8217;s search ad program, called AdWords, sells space on its search
                            pages to ads linked with specific keywords. Google auctions off the keyword
                            ads, with prime keywords and page locations going to the highest bidder.
                            Google recently added a program called AdSense, which allows any Web site to
                            display targeted Google ads related to the content of its site. Web site
                            publishers earn money every time visitors click on these ads.</p>
                        <p>In addition to offering prime online &#8220;real estate&#8221; for
                            advertisers, Google adds value by providing tools to better target their ads
                            and better understand the effectiveness of their marketing. Google
                            Analytics, free to Google&#8217;s advertisers, provides a custom report, or
                            dashboard, detailing how Internet users found the site, what ads they saw
                            and/or clicked on, how they behaved while there, and how much traffic was
                            generated. Google client Discount Tire was able <a id="page53"
                                class="pagebreak" title="53"></a>to identify where visitors encountered
                            problems that led them to abandon a purchase midstream. After modifying its
                            site and updating its keyword search campaign, Discount Tire measured a 14
                            percent increase in sales within a week.</p>
                        <p>With its ability to deploy data that enable up-to-theminute improvements in a
                            Web marketing program, Google supports a style of marketing in which the
                            advertising resources and budget can be constantly monitored and optimized.
                            Google calls this approach &#8220;marketing asset management,&#8221;
                            implying that advertising should be managed like assets in a portfolio
                            depending on the market conditions. Rather than following a marketing plan
                            developed months in advance, companies use the real-time data collected on
                            their campaigns to optimize the campaign&#8217;s effectiveness and be more
                            responsive to the market.</p>
                        <p>Over the past decade, Google has expanded far beyond its search capabilities
                            with numerous other services, applications, and tools. It creates and
                            distributes its products for free, which in turn provide new opportunities
                            for the firm to sell additional targeted advertising space. Since 97 percent
                            of Google&#8217;s revenues come from online advertising, new advertising
                            space is critical to the company&#8217;s growth.</p>
                        <p>Google&#8217;s wide range of products and services fall into five categories:
                            desktop products, mobile products, Web products, hardware products, and
                            other products. <span class="emphasis">Desktop products</span> include both
                            stand-alone applications such as Google Earth (a virtual globe that uses
                            satellite imagery and aerial photography), Google Chrome (a Web browser),
                            and Google Video/YouTube (Google acquired the video hosting site YouTube in
                            2006 for $1.65 billion), or desktop extensions such as Google Toolbar (a
                            browser toolbar). <span class="emphasis">Mobile products</span> include all
                            Google products available for mobile devices. <span class="emphasis">Web
                                products</span> are broken down into the following
                            subsets&#8212;advertising (e.g., AdWorks, DoubleClick, Click-to-Call),
                            communications and publishing (e.g., Google Docs, Google Calendar, Google
                            Gadgets, Wave), development (e.g., Android, Google Code), mapping (e.g.,
                            Google Sky, Google Maps), Search (e.g., Google Dictionary, Google Alerts,
                            Google Scholar), and statistics (e.g., Google Trends, Google Analytics).</p>
                        <p>Google&#8217;s stage of development starts within Google Labs, which lists
                            new products available for testing. It next moves to beta status, where
                            invited users test early prototypes. Once the product is fully tested and
                            ready to be released to the general public, it moves into the gold stage as
                            a core Google product. Google Voice, for example, is in the beta stage. It
                            provides consumers with one Google phone number, which then connects to the
                            user&#8217;s home, office, and cell numbers. The user decides which phones
                            ring, based on who calls. Due to Google Voice&#8217;s complexity and
                            popularity, users can sign up only by invitation.</p>
                        <p>Google has not spent a lot of money on traditional advertising. Recent
                            efforts have targeted Microsoft consumers with appeals to use Google&#8217;s
                            &#8220;cloud computing&#8221; applications instead of Microsoft Office or
                            Windows. By &#8220;Going Google,&#8221; a user can access all of his or her
                            documents and applications via a Web browser instead of owning the physical
                            infrastructure and software. In addition, in 2009 Google launched its
                            first-ever television commercial for Google Chrome, an alternative to
                            Microsoft&#8217;s Internet Explorer Web browser.</p>
                        <p>Google is also betting big in the mobile category. With its 2008 launch of
                            Android, a mobile operating system, Google went head-to-head with
                            Apple&#8217;s iPhone. Although many still prefer Apple&#8217;s platform,
                            even critics have praised Android&#8217;s benefits. Most importantly,
                            Android is free, open sourced, and backed by a multimillion-dollar
                            investment. That means Google wants its partners to help build and design
                            Android over the years. In addition, the iPhone is available only through
                            AT&#38;T in the United States, while most of AT&#38;T&#8217;s competitors
                            support Android phones. If Google influences millions of new consumers to
                            use smart phones, it could make billions in mobile advertising. One analyst
                            stated that Google &#8220;is trying to get ahead of the curve with these
                            initiatives so when [mobile advertising] becomes mainstream, Google will be
                            one of the major players, and display is a key growth area for
                            Google.&#8221;</p>
                        <p>Google&#8217;s goal is to reach as many people as possible on the
                            Web&#8212;whether by PC or by phone. The more users on the Web, the more
                            advertising Google can sell. Google&#8217;s new products also accomplish
                            this goal and make the Web a more personalized experience. One program
                            allows users to mark their current position on Google Maps, click the local
                            tab, and receive information about local restaurants, bars, and
                            entertainment venues.</p>
                        <p>Google has enjoyed great success as a company and a brand since its launch.
                            When it experienced an hour-long outage in 2009, worldwide Internet traffic
                            decreased by 5 percent. In 2009, Google held a 65 percent market share in
                            search in the United States, significantly greater than second place
                            Yahoo!&#8217;s 20 percent market share. Globally, Google held a more
                            dominant lead with 89 percent market share versus Yahoo!&#8217;s 5 percent
                            and MSN&#8217;s 3 percent. Google&#8217;s revenues topped $21 billion in
                            2008, and the company was ranked the most powerful brand in the world with a
                            brand value of $86 billion.</p>
